HaudioFeel was built using react. The spotify and youtube video search APIs were used to fetch songs as described in the diagram above. If you want to fork this repo, you would require access credentials from both APIs.

## Limitations

Youtube data API has a quota limit of 10,000 daily units. With each search request costing 100 units, a user can cycle between 100 songs daily before the quota is reached.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Allow users to add songs to their spotify or youtube playlists
- [ ] Improve UI, add dark and light modes
